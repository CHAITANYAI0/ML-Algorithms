svm classification - 

In svm classification along side hyperplane (best fit line) there are n (2 in case of binary classification) number of marginal planes.
Our aim in svm is to maximize the distance between the two marginal planes.

If we find all the lines which are linearly separable then it is called hard marginal plane (no errors) (ideal case)
with errors it is called soft marginl plane.


equations of straight line

ax+by+c=0 which is same as y=mx+c
